- What was the hardest part to understand?: The hardest part was managing and checking the new object after writing the whole code. It can be confusing to keep track of how each method affects the internal data, especially when songs are added, deleted, or skipped.

- How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?: Using 'this' refers to the specific Playlist object, it allows each method to access and modify the playlist's own songs and current state.

- What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?: If I wrote this from scratch, I would consider using features for the object detail. Planning and structuring the code could make the process easier to expand later.
